<p><b>2048</b>, the game that we developed with python language on pygame is a remake of the popular mobile game 2048.</p>
<p>The game can be played in a 4x4 grid by moving and combining valued tiles in order to get a score of 2048.</p>
<p>When two tiles with the same number touch, if they are next to each other then they will merge into one with a value of the two tiles!</p>
<p><b><i>For example:</i></b></p>
<p>If two tiles with a value 2 are moved and are next to each other then they will merge into one tile with a value 4. If with a value 4 then the result will be 8 and etc.</p>

<p>The minimum value, integer in this game is 2. And all values of the game 2048 are even numbers.</p>
<p>Actually, because of the name of the game, the user wins when he scores 2048. However, if the user wants, he can score more than 2048 points too!</p>
